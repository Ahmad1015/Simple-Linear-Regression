# Simple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of simple linear regression in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Simple linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a numerical target variable based on a single input feature.

## Overview

In this project, we will:

- Explore a dataset
- Preprocess the data
- Implement simple linear regression
- Evaluate the model
- Make predictions

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install them using pip:

```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install pandas
  pip install matplotlib.pyplot
  pip install scikit-learn
```
## Usage

1) Clone this repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ahmad1015/Simple-Linear-Regression.git
  cd Simple-Linear-Regression
```
2) Launch Jupyter Notebook
3) Open the SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb notebook.
4) Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to understand and implement simple linear regression.
